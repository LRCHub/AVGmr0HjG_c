I want to live in the woods, I want to follow a new friend covered in fur on foot
back to their home, I want to meet their friends and family
It's nice to be known but I wouldn't blame them if they hate me
I'm sure I look just like the devil to them
I want to fall asleep in my bed more than a couple night of the week
without being stoned, I want to hug my friends and family
I hope they all know, I wouldn't have blamed them if they'd left me
But what a thrill it is to hear them say,
"Goodbye, I love you. See you tomorrow."
