Some call me a loser
Some call me a cheater
Some say I'm a selfish
Untalented dreamer
Cause all I try to do
Is keep my dream alive
But it's so hard to do
When your working 9 to 5
I've never been one afraid to die
But I'm afraid to leave behind
The precious life that grows
Through the sands of time
Cause now I've got two daughters
And I know they need their father
To help them make it through
All of the devious things that people do
Cause every moment counts
From the good times to the bad
I don't have time to envy
Those that got things I've never had
Cause the one thing most important
Is the one we take for granted
And until your life is on that line
I think it's the way God had planned it
To open up your eyes
And make you realize
That to some life is money
But what's money without life
Cause alls I need
Is the air that I breathe
And my friends and family
To believe in me

As deep as the abyss
Where the waters run
As deep as the land
Of the rising sun
You know I'm down
Even when them odds
Are against us
It doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters

As deep as the abyss
Where the waters run
As deep as the land
Of the rising sun
You know I'm down
Even when them odds
Are against us
It doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters

We bleed the same blood
We cry the same tears
We have the same fears
We pass the same years
We see the same stars
Under the same sky
We pass the same time
We all live and die
Cause friends and family
Wash thicker than blood
And if ya never felt love
Then I feel for you, Cuz
Cause lives pass above us in 747s
Deceased dwell below us
Before they go to heaven
Everything in between all has a meaning
Some stay connected
While others keep fiending
Looking for that meaning
But the lost can't be found
Drop to your caps and pray
Now can ya hear the sound
Do ya feel it
Do ya feel it comin
Two triple zero
The hunters are the hunted
Electrical currents
Conflict with the spirits
Ah do ya hear it
Ah or do ya feel it
Deep like seven leagues
Life intrigues intelligence
Got no time for clutter
You're late if there's hesitance
Put your foot forward
And there will be a helping hand
Take a step back
Then your stuck in the quick sand
Ingesting toxins keeps us locked in
A mental jail trap
99 where your family at

Oh and I might fail
Oh I might succeed
Whatever the outcome is
Just keep your faith in me
Just believe in me
And I will be there

As deep as the abyss
Where the waters run
As deep as the land
Of the rising sun
You know I'm down
Even when them odds
Are against us
It doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters

As deep as the abyss
Where the waters run
As deep as the land
Of the rising sun
You know I'm down
Even when them odds
Are against us
It doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters

As deep as the abyss
Where the waters run
As deep as the land
Of the rising sun
You know I'm down
Even when them odds
Are against us
It doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters

As deep as the abyss
Where the waters run
As deep as the land
Of the rising sun
You know I'm down
Even when them odds
Are against us
It doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters
