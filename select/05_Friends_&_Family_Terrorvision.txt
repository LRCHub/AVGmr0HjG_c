Party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
It's alright now cos' we just don't care,

Would you die for king and queen,
You got friends, you got family,
Do you belong to regime,
Or would you just go along with all that you believe,

All that you see,
Because I don't need no proof of I.D.
To see that I'm you and know that you're me,
It seems, It seems to be,
That we can't remember how it was when we were family,
Friends and family.

Now it's party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
It's alright now cos' we just don't care,

Where were you on new years eve,
Out with friends, or sitting home infront,
To read a book or watch T.V.
It's not a hard choice to make as worse things happen at sea,

All that you mean,
Because I don't need no proof of I.D.
To see that I'm you and know that you're me,
It seems, It seems to be,
That we can't remember how it was when we were family,
Friends and family.

Now it's party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,

It's alright now cos' we just don't care,
Would you die for king and queen?
When you're part friend and you're part family,

It seems to be,
That we can't remember how it was when we were family,
Friends and family.

Now it's party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
It's alright now cos' we just don't care,

Now it's party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
Party over here fuck you over there,
It's alright now cos' we just don't care.
